This is my first portfolio website built strictly with HTML, CSS, JS and SASS and is mostly an experimental endevour learning full-stack development.
The project has many known flaws, as this experience was somewhat learn-as-you-go - this was most definately a learning experience.

As per the license, you are free to copy and tweak this work to be unique to you and use it as you wish.

The repository linked is not collaborative, however criticsm of the project is accepted.

Thank you.
